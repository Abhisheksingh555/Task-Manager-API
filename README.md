# Task Manager API

The **Task Manager API** is a backend application designed to manage tasks efficiently through RESTful API endpoints. It is an ideal project for developers aiming to enhance their backend skills and gain real-world experience in building scalable APIs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This API allows users to perform CRUD operations on tasks, manage user authentication, and organize tasks by projects, categories, or status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed). It can be extended with additional features like due dates, priority levels, tags, and activity tracking.

---

## 🎯 Why This is an Ideal Project

- ✅ Real-world use case for productivity tools
- ✅ Covers core backend skills: routing, middleware, and database integration
- ✅ Implements authentication and role-based access control
- ✅ Teaches modular code organization and error handling
- ✅ Can be extended with search, filtering, and pagination
- ✅ Prepares you for building production-ready RESTful APIs

---

## 🛠️ Features

- User Registration and Login (JWT Auth)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) for Tasks
- Task categorization by project/status
- Set due dates and priorities
- Role-based access (e.g., Admin, User)
- Activity logs (optional)
- API input validation and error handling

## 📁 Folder Structure (Suggestion)

### 📝 Description of Key Folders

- **`src/`**: Main application logic lives here.
  - `index.js`: Initializes the app and starts the server.
  - `models/`: Defines data schemas or models.
  - `controllers/`: Handles incoming requests and returns responses.
  - `middlewares/`: Contains reusable middleware functions like auth, logger, etc.
  - `routes/`: Defines application routes and attaches controllers.
  - `services/`: Contains core business logic.
  - `repository/`: Manages low-level DB queries and persistence logic.
  - `config/`: Holds configuration files (e.g., DB config, env parser).
  - `utils/`: Utility/helper functions.
  - `migrations/`: Manages DB schema evolution (mainly for SQL DBs).
  - `seeders/`: Seeds initial or test data into the database.

- **`tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests.

- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

- **`.env`**: Stores environment-specific variables (API keys, DB URIs, etc.).
